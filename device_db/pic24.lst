# PIC24 and dsPIC30 devices.
# Sizes are given in 32-bit words. This means that the program size should be specified as the
# number of instructions (each instruction being 24 bits of data and 8 0-bits). Addresses are
# specified in two-byte increments. This allows copying the addresses as specified in the data
# sheets. config_address is usually F80000h. config_size should be (address of the last address
# word - F80000h) / 2 + 1. eeprom_size should be specified in the number of 2-byte words, as in the
# HEX file the words are also padded to 32 bits.
